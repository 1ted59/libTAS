## ToDo list

- Support game controller
- Dump video
- Dump audio
- Add inputs into the game screen
- Add key remapping
- Add config file for hotkeys and key remapping (libconfig?)
- Deal with keyboard mapping and stuff
- Write a better compile script
- Process and filter SDL events

## Partially done

- Inject inputs to the game (only keyboard for now)
- Standardize communication between game and program
- Support fast-forward (some desyncs if done at the very beginning of the game)
- Switch from read-only to write (incomplete without savestates)
- Support savestates (good luck)
  Got this error while loading: 
    Assertion 'e->pollfd->fd == e->fd' failed at pulse/mainloop.c:655, function dispatch_pollfds(). Aborting.
    Assertion 'pa_atomic_load(&(b)->_ref) > 0' failed at pulsecore/memblock.c:597, function pa_memblock_unref(). Aborting.

## Done

- Don't send keys that correspond to hotkeys
- Record inputs and support playback
