 *
 *  There is no way to recover the return code of a detached thread. If you
 *  need this, don't detach the thread and instead use SDL_WaitThread().

 *  SDL_WaitThread() to finally clean it up. As such, don't detach the same
 *  thread more than once.
 *
 *  If a thread has already exited when passed to SDL_DetachThread(), it will
 *  stop waiting for a call to SDL_WaitThread() and clean up immediately.
