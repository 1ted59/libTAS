## ToDo list

### Compatibility

- Support non SDL stuff
- Add dummy Steam API functions so that the game can be launched without it
-- Headers: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/tree/master/sp/src/public/steam

### Features

- Add a memory watch/search module
- Use incremental savestates (using /proc/self/pagemap and soft_dirty flag)

### Fixes

- Awake the game window to prevent the server for considering it as frozen
- Remove as much X events to process as possible to avoid using SDL_PumpEvents, because they are just hidden inputs. Also, they call SDL_Ticks(), which is bad

## Partially done

- Dump video
-- Some muxers do not work (mp4)
-- Must support or disable screen resizing
- Support savestates
-- Still some errors...
- Dump audio
-- Test SDL 2 Audio (push method)
-- Crash in Dustforce: "Assertion 0 failed at libswresample/rematrix.c:414"
- Add an interface (fltk)
-- Check for validity of encoding parameters
-- Allow the user to set the working directories
-- Allow the user to delete savestates
- Support Unity
-- Detect game exiting to stop audio buffering
-- Update window title
-- Looks like hollowknight is using udev for joysticks
-- Rendering is not done on the "main" thread (the first one). Decide what to do

## Done

- Prevent game from redirecting stdout/stderr to a log file
- Hook pulse audio
- Record inputs and support playback
- Add options to speedup software rendering
- Add fake-savestating (saving inputs and reset/fastforward/pause)
- Add config file for hotkeys and key remapping
- Add a thread local flag saying if calls are made by the game or by our code (callerisunstrusted in Hourglass)
- Don't send keys that correspond to hotkeys
- Write a better compile script
- Support fast-forward (some desyncs if done at the very beginning of the game)
- Inject keyboard inputs to the game
- Add an auto-repeat for frame advance
- Support game controller
- Support non-gamecontroller joysticks
- Add a deterministic timer instead of relying on SwapInterval
- Allow 32-bit or 64-bit lib compilation
- Add key remapping
- Add both (non)/deterministic timers
- Better manage static and dynamic hooking
- Add a license
- Support mouse
- Emulate our own event queue
- Memory manager
- Support software rendering
- Add inputs into the game screen
