/* TODO: I really don't like this extern, but let's use it for now.
 * The thing is that we need the UI to be able to save the movie.
 * In the scenario where the UI sends a command for the game-handling thread to
 * save, it can lead to a problematic case, because if the game is frozen, the
 * game-handling thread is waiting forever for the frame boundary and never
 * perform its actions, including the movie saving. It is safer for the UI
 * thread to perform the save itself, because it is less likely to be stuck.
