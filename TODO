## ToDo list

- Support game controller
- Dump audio
- Add inputs into the game screen
- Add key remapping
- Add config file for hotkeys and key remapping (libconfig?)
- Deal with keyboard mapping and stuff
- Write a better compile script
- Process and filter SDL events
- Add a memory watch/search module

## Partially done

- Inject inputs to the game (only keyboard for now)
- Standardize communication between game and program
-- Rewrite the socket sharing to assure that full information is send/receive (for arrays mainly)
- Support fast-forward (some desyncs if done at the very beginning of the game)
- Switch from read-only to write (incomplete without savestates)
- Dump video
-- Some muxers do not work (mp4)
-- Must support or disable screen resizing
- Support savestates (good luck)
-- Disable openAL sound, remove one error
-- Now got:
    [xcb] Unknown sequence number while processing queue
    [xcb] Most likely this is a multi-threaded client and XInitThreads has not been called
    [xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
    SuperMeatBoy: ../../src/xcb_io.c:274: poll_for_event: Assertion `!xcb_xlib_threads_sequence_lost' failed.

## Done

- Don't send keys that correspond to hotkeys
- Record inputs and support playback
