/*
 * Memory Manager
 * --------------
 * This is a manager of dynamic allocations that allows us to have full control of the heap.
 * This manager uses a bitmap heap implementation that is described by Leonard Kevin McGuire Jr:
 * http://wiki.osdev.org/User:Pancakes/BitmapHeapImplementation
 * The principle is to store at the beginning of an allocated segment a map which holds information
 * about which blocks are free or used and to distinguish different allocations using ids.
 * As an optimization, it uses a next fit technique where new allocations are preferably done
 * next to recent allocations, in order to improve caching.
 * Moreover, memory is requested from the system using mmap and is tagged as shared, so that
 * it can easily be accessed from the executable, in order to have an effective RAM Search.
 * Another benefit to shared memory is that it becomes easier to manage save states with
 * these over regular RAM pages as we can have full READ / WRITE access from the executable side,
 * as well as shared ownership.
