/* This is the mixing uber-function that does all the hard work.
 * There is a heavy focus on performance here,
 * so this tries to do everything and do it "well enough", with nothing really fancy.
 * 
 * FREQUENCY ADJUSTMENT:
 *   This handles conversion from any frequency to any other frequency.
 *   The adjustment amount is decided implicitly based on the ratio between size and outSize.
 * BIT RATE CONVERSION:
 *   This handles all possible combinations of bitrate conversions between the following types:
 *   (8-bit signed, 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit signed, and 16-bit unsigned)
 *   as determined by the types you specify for fromtype and totype.
 *   in practice, only the following 4 combinations are useful:
 *   (8-bit unsigned to 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit signed to 16-bit signed,
 *    8-bit unsigned to 16-bit signed, and 16-bit signed to 8-bit unsigned)
 *   however, it is recommended the mixing destination buffer always be 16-bit, for quality reasons.
 * CHANNEL CONVERSION:
 *   This handles all 4 possible combinations of channel conversions
 *   (mono to mono, stereo to stereo, mono to stereo, and stereo to mono)
 *   as determined by the values you specify for fromchannels and tochannels.
 *   However, it is recommended the mixing destination buffer always be stereo, for quality reasons.
 * PANNING AND VOLUME ADJUSTMENT:
 *   The volume levels given ( range [0,65536) ) are applied to the source audio when mixing.
 *   This automatically includes panning, which applies for every case except (mono to mono) conversion.
 * CLIPPING:
 *   Values exceeding the bounds of the destination bitrate will be clamped to within the valid range.
 * INTERPOLATION:
 *   This performs linear interpolation of samples.
 *   Some games would sound very noticeably wrong otherwise.
