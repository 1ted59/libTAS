        * permission there.

        * EDIT: We should only skip the "---p" section for the shared libraries.
        * Anonymous memory areas with no rwx permission should be saved regardless
        * as the process might have removed the permissions temporarily and might
        * want to use it later.
        *
        * This happens, for example, with libpthread where the pthread library
        * tries to recycle thread stacks. When a thread exits, libpthread will
        * remove the access permissions from the thread stack and later, when a
        * new thread is created, it will provide the proper permission to this
        * area and use it as the thread stack.
        *
        * If we do not restore this area on restart, the area might be returned by
        * some mmap() call. Later on, when pthread wants to use this area, it will
        * just try to use this area which now belongs to some other object. Even
        * worse, the other object can then call munmap() on that area after
        * libpthread started using it as thread stack causing the parts of thread
        * stack getting munmap()'d from the memory resulting in a SIGSEGV.
        *
        * We suspect that libpthread is using mmap() instead of mprotect to change
        * the permission from "---p" to "rw-p".
        *
        * Also, on SUSE 12, if this region was part of heap, the protected region
        * may have the label "[heap]".  So, we also save the memory region if it
        * has label "[heap]", "[stack]", or  "[stack:XXX]".
